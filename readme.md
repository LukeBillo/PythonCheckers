Game Rules:

- One move per turn, except in special circumstances.
- Can only move one diagonal space per turn, except in special circumstances.
- If an opponent's checker is positioned diagonally from the other player's checker and it has no checker behind it, the checker can be 'jumped over' and destroyed. (Shown by move assist.)
- If another jump can be made after doing the first jump, another turn is given to the player.
- Red checkers can only move upwards, except when in 'king' status.
- White checkers can only move downwards, except when in 'king' status.
- Kings can move in all directions around the board.
- King status is achieved for a checker when they reach the far side of the board from their starting point.
- Turns alternate between each team. (Example: Red->White->Red->White.)
- The team which starts the game is decided pseudo-randomly.
